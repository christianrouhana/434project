# 434project

This is my course project for my Computer Science 434 course at Washington State University. I investigate the new activation function 'Mish' and its effects on model efficacy in a specific example. More information can be found in the .ipynb/.html file and the paper that was written for this investigation. 

This README file will be updated after the conclusion of my semester.
