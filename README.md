# WSU - CPTS 434 Final Project

This is my course project for my Computer Science 434 course at Washington State University. I investigate the new activation function 'Mish' and its effects on model efficacy in a specific example. More information can be found in the mish_vs_relu_ac.ipynb/.html file and the paper that was written for this investigation. 

Please send any questions to christian.rouhana@wsu.edu
